Aman states Gaboderm is the best medicine according to statistics. The AI prompts Aman to focus on presenting research-based information confidently and asks about similar successful scenarios with HCPs. Aman doesn't remember any successful interactions other than when the HCP wanted the medicine, and the AI prompts him to recall if any HCPs have told him how to convince them. Aman suggests showing data and convincing them of Gaboderm's superiority. The AI agrees and asks if Aman has heard a teammate use a great question during a selling village or training event. Aman responds that he hasn't because such strategies are kept secret, and he is not included in those meetings. The AI suggests brainstorming ideas and asks Aman to think of other strategies to present his data more effectively. Aman asks for help, and the AI suggests using an analogy of a teacher explaining a complex topic to students in a simple and engaging manner.
